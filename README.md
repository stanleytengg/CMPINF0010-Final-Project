## Description
Through this project, we devised a way to identify Pittsburgh's best neighborhood strategically. Since there are multiple ways to interpret what's considered the "best," we interpreted this in terms of safety (crimes, disasters) and stability (income). For a neighborhood to be considered a quality place to live, it must be safe and stable.   
We are measuring the total number of `arrests`, `fire incidents`, and the `income` for each neighborhood in Pittsburgh given the following datasets:
- Police Arrests: https://data.wprdc.org/datastore/dump/e03a89dd-134a-4ee8-a2bd-62c40aeebc6f
- Fire Incidents: https://data.wprdc.org/datastore/dump/8d76ac6b-5ae8-4428-82a4-043130d17b02
- Total Income: https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/c6265ffb-c86e-4a2c-870b-1aaa0772c449/resource/14abb000-d066-4728-8ffa-227883d6c331/download/wage-or-salary-income-in-the-past-12-months-for-households.csv
